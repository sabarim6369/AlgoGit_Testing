Here is a step-by-step explanation of the given code:

The code is designed to find the diameter of a binary tree, which is defined as the longest path between two nodes in the tree. 

1. The class Solution has a variable maxdiameter which is initialized as 0. This variable will store the maximum diameter found in the binary tree.

2. The function helper is a recursive function used to calculate the diameter of the binary tree. The function takes a TreeNode* node as a parameter, which represents the current node in the binary tree.

3. If the node is a null pointer (i.e., if the node does not exist), the function returns 0. This is a base case for the recursion.

4. If the node exists, the function calculates the depth of the left subtree (leftmax) and the right subtree (rightmax) by recursively calling the helper function on these subtrees.

5. It then updates the maxdiameter with the maximum value of its current value and the sum of leftmax and rightmax. This is because the diameter of the tree can be calculated as the maximum diameter of the left subtree and the right subtree, and the depth of the current node (1 + max(leftmax, rightmax)).

6. The function then returns 1 + max(leftmax, rightmax), which represents the depth of the current node.

7. The diameterOfBinaryTree function initializes the maxdiameter with 0 and then calls the helper function on the root node of the binary tree. Finally, it returns the maxdiameter, which represents the diameter of the binary tree.

The code works by traversing the binary tree in a depth-first manner, calculating the depth of each node and updating the maxdiameter with the maximum diameter found so far. This way, it efficiently calculates the diameter of the binary tree.
