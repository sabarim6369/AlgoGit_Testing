Here is a step-by-step explanation of the given code:

1. The code defines a binary tree node structure `TreeNode` which has three properties: `val` to hold the value of the node, `left` and `right` to hold the left and right child nodes respectively.

2. The code defines a class `Solution` that calculates the diameter of a binary tree.

3. Inside the `Solution` class, the `maxdiameter` variable is initialized to 0. This variable will keep track of the maximum diameter found in the binary tree.

4. The `helper` function is defined. This function is a recursive function that calculates the diameter of a given binary tree node.

5. Inside the `helper` function:
    - It first checks if the given node is `NULL`. If it is, the function returns 0 because there are no edges in a `NULL` node.
    - Then it calculates the maximum diameter of the left and right subtrees using recursive calls to `helper`.
    - It updates the `maxdiameter` variable if the maximum diameter of the left and right subtrees is greater than the current `maxdiameter`.
    - Finally, it returns 1 plus the maximum height of the left and right subtrees. The maximum height is calculated as the maximum of the heights of the left and right subtrees.

6. The `diameterOfBinaryTree` function is defined. This function is the main function that calculates the diameter of a binary tree.

7. Inside the `diameterOfBinaryTree` function:
    - It calls the `helper` function with the root node of the binary tree.
    - The `helper` function updates the `maxdiameter` variable based on the maximum diameter of the left and right subtrees.
    - Finally, the function returns the `maxdiameter` variable which represents the maximum diameter of the binary tree.

The time complexity of this code is O(n) and the space complexity is O(n) due to the recursive nature of the code, where n is the number of nodes in the binary tree.
