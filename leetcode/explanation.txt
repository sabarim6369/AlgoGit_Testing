Here's a step-by-step explanation of the given code:

**Class TreeNode**

This class defines a binary tree node. Each node has three properties:

1. `val`: an integer value stored in the node.
2. `left`: a pointer to the left child node.
3. `right`: a pointer to the right child node.

There are three constructors for creating a `TreeNode` object:

1. `TreeNode()`: initializes the node with a value of 0, and sets `left` and `right` to `nullptr`.
2. `TreeNode(int x)`: initializes the node with the given value `x`, and sets `left` and `right` to `nullptr`.
3. `TreeNode(int x, TreeNode* left, TreeNode* right)`: initializes the node with the given value `x`, and sets `left` and `right` to the given child nodes.

**Class Solution**

This class contains three methods:

1. `maxdiameter`: an integer variable initialized to 0, which will store the maximum diameter of the binary tree.
2. `helper(TreeNode* node)`: a recursive function that calculates the diameter of the binary tree recursively. It takes a node as input and returns the diameter of the subtree rooted at this node.
3. `diameterOfBinaryTree(TreeNode* root)`: a method that initializes the `maxdiameter` variable to 0, calls the `helper` function with the root node as input, and returns the maximum diameter found.

**Helper function**

The `helper` function is a recursive function that calculates the diameter of the binary tree. Here's a step-by-step explanation of how it works:

1. If the input node is `nullptr`, return 0, because the diameter of an empty tree is 0.
2. Calculate the maximum depth of the left subtree using the `helper` function recursively.
3. Calculate the maximum depth of the right subtree using the `helper` function recursively.
4. Update the `maxdiameter` variable by taking the maximum of the current `maxdiameter` value and the sum of the maximum depths of the left and right subtrees.
5. Return the maximum depth of the current subtree, which is 1 plus the maximum of the depths of the left and right subtrees.

**Diameter of the binary tree**

The `diameterOfBinaryTree` method initializes the `maxdiameter` variable to 0 and calls the `helper` function with the root node as input. The `helper` function calculates the diameter of the binary tree recursively, and the `maxdiameter` variable stores the maximum diameter found. Finally, the method returns the maximum diameter found.

The diameter of a binary tree is the longest path between any two nodes in the tree. The `helper` function calculates the diameter by recursively traversing the tree and updating the `maxdiameter` variable accordingly.
