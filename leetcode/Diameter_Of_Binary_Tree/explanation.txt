Here's a step-by-step explanation of the code:

**What is the problem?**

The problem is to find the diameter of a binary tree. The diameter of a binary tree is the longest path between any two nodes in a tree. This path may or may not pass through the root.

**What is the solution?**

The solution is to use a recursive function `helper` to calculate the diameter of the binary tree. Here's how it works:

1. If the node is `null`, return 0, which means the diameter of an empty tree is 0.

2. Call the `helper` function recursively on the left and right subtrees of the current node, and store the results in `leftmax` and `rightmax`. These values represent the maximum diameter of the left and right subtrees.

3. Update `maxdiameter` with the maximum value between the current `maxdiameter` and the sum of `leftmax` and `rightmax`. This ensures that `maxdiameter` always stores the maximum diameter found so far.

4. Calculate the maximum depth (`leftmax` or `rightmax`) of the left and right subtrees, and return `1` plus the maximum depth. This is because the diameter of the current node is the sum of the maximum depths of its left and right subtrees, plus `1` for the current node.

**How does the `diameterOfBinaryTree` function work?**

The `diameterOfBinaryTree` function simply calls the `helper` function on the root node of the binary tree, and returns the `maxdiameter` value calculated by `helper`. This value represents the maximum diameter of the binary tree.

**Timing and space complexity**

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the binary tree, because we visit each node once. The space complexity is O(h), where h is the height of the binary tree, because of the recursive call stack.

I hope this explanation helps! Let me know if you have any questions.
