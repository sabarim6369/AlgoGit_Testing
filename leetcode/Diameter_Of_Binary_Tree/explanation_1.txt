Here's a step-by-step explanation of the concept used in the given code:

**Understanding the Problem**

The problem is to find the diameter of a binary tree, which is the length of the longest path across the tree. The diameter of a binary tree is the maximum path length from a node to a node that is not a descendant of that node.

**TreeNode Structure**

The code defines a `TreeNode` struct, which represents a node in the binary tree. Each node has an integer value (`val`), a pointer to its left child (`left`), and a pointer to its right child (`right`). The constructor for the `TreeNode` class initializes the node with a value and initializes its children to `nullptr`.

**Solution Class**

The code defines a `Solution` class, which contains a method to find the diameter of a binary tree.

**helper Method**

The `helper` method is a recursive function that takes a `TreeNode*` (a pointer to a node in the binary tree) as input and returns an integer representing the maximum diameter found so far.

Here's how the `helper` method works:

1. If the input node is `nullptr`, the function returns 0, indicating that there is no node to process.
2. The function recursively calls itself on the left and right children of the input node, storing the results in `leftmax` and `rightmax`, respectively.
3. The function calculates the maximum diameter found so far by taking the maximum of the current diameter value (`maxdiameter`) and the sum of the left and right maximum diameters (`leftmax + rightmax`). This ensures that the maximum diameter is updated correctly.
4. The function returns the maximum diameter found in the left and right subtrees, plus 1 (to account for the current node).

**diameterOfBinaryTree Method**

The `diameterOfBinaryTree` method is the main entry point for the solution. It takes a `TreeNode*` (a pointer to the root of the binary tree) as input and returns the diameter of the binary tree.

Here's how the `diameterOfBinaryTree` method works:

1. The method calls the `helper` method recursively on the root node, passing the root node as input.
2. The `helper` method updates the `maxdiameter` value with the maximum diameter found in the binary tree.
3. The method returns the maximum diameter value found in the binary tree, which is stored in the `maxdiameter` variable.

In summary, the code uses a recursive approach to find the diameter of a binary tree by traversing the tree and updating the maximum diameter value as it goes. The `helper` method is used to recursively traverse the tree and update the maximum diameter value, while the `diameterOfBinaryTree` method serves as the main entry point for the solution.
